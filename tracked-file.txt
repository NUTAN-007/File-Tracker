🚀 DevOps at Modak: Where Code Meets Culture

In today’s engineering world, delivering fast isn’t enough — we need to deliver smart, secure, and scalable solutions. That’s where DevOps comes in.

At Modak, we’re building tools that don't just automate processes — they **empower engineers**. One such tool is our internal platform: the **Static File Tracker**.

---

🎯 What It Does:

- ✅ Tracks changes made to a specific file in GitHub
- 🕵️‍♀️ Logs author, timestamp, and content changes to PostgreSQL
- 🔄 Automatically updates the live UI via a sidecar container
- 🔐 Secure, auditable, and cloud-native
- 🚀 Deployed with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes

---

💡 Why It Matters:

This tracker helps our teams:

- Maintain **transparency** across collaborative changes  
- Monitor **content lifecycle** in real-time  
- Provide a **source of truth** for documentation and internal notes  
- Use Git as a **trigger for operations**, not just code
